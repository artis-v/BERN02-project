    "# The project\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to create a statistical model that can predict how many constituencies each of the five considered parties is going to win in the 2019 UK election, given a set of the first constituency results that were announced, as well as the results of the three previous elections (2017, 2015, 2010) in each constituency, results from the 2016 Brexit referendum, and census data about each constituency from 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the purpose is to predict the number of constituencies each of the parties will win out of the remaining constituencies.\n",
